         <p>Bucatini carbonara is a personal favorite recipe of mine. In addition to being delicious, it is also easy to make. More specialty ingredients like guancale can be easily substituted for more easily sourced bacon. The key to getting this recipe correct, is making sure the heavy cream-cheese-egg yolk ratio is correct, and using a double boiler to avoid over cooking the egg.</p>
